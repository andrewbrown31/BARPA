# BARPA
A collection of notebooks and scripts for analysing data from the Bureau of Meteorology Atmospheric Regional Projections for Australia (BARPA). Analysis mostly focuses on severe surface wind gusts and related large-scale environments from trial runs produced for the [Electricity Sector Climate Information (ESCI) project](https://www.climatechangeinaustralia.gov.au/en/projects/esci/)

The [`wind_gust_analysis/`](wind_gust_analysis) directory contains notebooks and scripts that relate to the work for a manuscript, presenting model evaluation and future projections. A log within that directory details the relevant scripts, and how they are used. Some code for that same manuscript is also in the [`lightning_analysis/`](lightning_analysis) directory
